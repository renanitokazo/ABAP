ABAP Project: ZRENANTESTE2
This is an ABAP project example demonstrating the use of interfaces, classes, unit testing, and MVC Pattern. The project includes a real model, a mock model, a controller, and a view to manage and display system messages.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Classes and Interfaces
zif_model: Interface defining the select_t100 method for selecting records from the T100 table.

lcl_model: Real implementation of zif_model. This model retrieves actual records from the T100 table in the database.

lcl_model_fake: Mock implementation of zif_model. This model provides fixed example data for testing purposes.

lcl_controller: Controller that interacts with the model to fetch data and provide it to the view.

lcl_view: View that uses the controller to obtain and display data.

Unit Tests
ltc_test: Test class that verifies the functionality of the lcl_model_fake class and the controller.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need an ABAP environment configured in SAP, with access to the SAP system and the T100 table.

Usage
Running the Report
To execute the report, use transaction SE38 or SA38 and enter the report name ZRENANTESTE2. The report will display messages from the T100 table.

Unit Tests
Unit tests are written to ensure the functionality of the mock implementation and the controller. To run the tests, use transaction SE80 and execute the test class ltc_test in the unit testing tab.

Example Code
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how the mock model is used to provide data:

abap

DATA(o_fake_model) = NEW lcl_model_fake( ).
DATA(o_controller) = NEW lcl_controller( o_fake_model ).
DATA(lt_t100) = o_controller->select_t100( ).

LOOP AT lt_t100 ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_t100>).
  WRITE: / <fs_t100>-text.
ENDLOOP.
